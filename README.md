# Home Assistant Community Add-on: Lidarr

Looks and smells like Sonarr but made for music.

## About

[Lidarr] is a music collection manager for Usenet and BitTorrent users. It can
monitor multiple RSS feeds for new tracks from your favorite artists and will
grab, sort and rename them. It can also be configured to automatically upgrade
the quality of files already downloaded when a better quality format becomes
available.
